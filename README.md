This repository showcases my **Business Analyst portfolio project**, where I documented and designed a proposed **Online Library Reservation System**.

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Library Reservation System** aims to allow library members to:  
- Search books online by genre, author, and release date  
- Check availability and reserve books remotely  
- Get notified when reserved/out-of-stock books are available  
- Explore new releases  

This solves the problem of wasted visits and improves member satisfaction.
